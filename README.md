# Pixeldex
[This mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixeldex/) is for use with Pixelmon Reforged.  
Pixeldex is a mod inspired by Xenoyia's PokedexRewards mod. SimpleDexRewards did not cut it for me, so I made my own version with Xenoyia's version in mind.  

Pixeldex rewards players per 10% completion of their pokedex. Rewards include items and commands, which is configurable by the server-owner.  
For more information about commands, click [here](https://github.com/qwbarch/Pixeldex/wiki/Commands "Commands").  
For more information about the configuration, click [here](https://github.com/qwbarch/Pixeldex/wiki/Configuration "Configuration").  

[Shiny Token](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shiny-token "Shiny Token") is a feature from Xenoyia's mod, cut into its own separate mod. This can be used as a command reward, if desired.  
This mod is only required on the server, client is optional.
